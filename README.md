Topic: Electronics & Groceries Inventory tracking system

Purpose:
The purpose of the project is to help new incoming graduate and undergraduate students with lowest price for groceries, electronics, and household items in stores. 

Table Explanation:

•	Retailers: This table will consist of data about the stores and retailers shop in and near Boston. 

•	Electronics/Groceries/Household:  We will incorporate items information in these tables considering specific retailers from Retailers table. This database is supposed to show mainly the prices, quantity, ingredients of items.

•	Branch: This table consists of branch name and location of the Store. 

•	Electronics Sale: As electronics are costlier and their prices differ month to month, we have kept this table so that students can figure out in which month would they like to buy electronic and when the prices are low and sales are high.

Our goal is to help students with the best time to buy the items for the lowest price among all the retailers. Furthermore, which retailer has sold an ample number of products and provides the best offers among all the retailers would be shown.
Tentative Tables: Retailers, Electronics, Electronics Sales, Groceries, Household Items, Branch etc.
